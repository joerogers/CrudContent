# DEPRECATED

Recommend using Room instead. This library originated before Room was written, but is much more limited in functionality.

# CrudContent

Gradle
------

```Gradle
dependencies {
    com.forkingcode.crudcontent:crudcontent:{latest version above}'
}
```

Note: This library will also add the support-v4 library to your project.

See [Wiki](https://github.com/joerogers/CrudContent/wiki) for usage instructions
